  Eff is a programming language based on the algebraic approach to
  computational effects, in which effects are viewed as algebraic
  operations and effect handlers as homomorphisms from free
  algebras. Eff supports first-class effects and handlers through
  which we may easily define new computational effects, seamlessly
  combine existing ones, and handle them in novel ways. We give a
  denotational semantics of eff and discuss a prototype implementation
  based on it. Through examples we demonstrate how the standard
  effects are treated in eff, and how eff supports programming
  techniques that use various forms of delimited continuations, such
  as backtracking, breadth-first search, selection functionals,
  cooperative multi-threading, and others.
