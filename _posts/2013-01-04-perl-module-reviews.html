Title: List of Perl Module Reviews

CPAN is so wonderful that any task imaginable has already been thought up and implemented as a Perl module. Actually, it should be plural, as in several module*s*. For example, there are *nine* different modules on CPAN that parse browser User-Agent strings!

This makes the task of choosing the best tool for the task somewhat arduous. Sometimes, you just want to pick something, use it and move on. This is where the articles comparing features of each such module are so useful and important. Granted, CPAN modules aren't static, and some authors constantly improve their work (a good thing!), which makes any such article outdated. But, as the saying goes, anything is better than nothing.

Obviously, there are several such articles all over the 'nets. Now, [Ron Savage](http://savage.net.au/) has put together a cool and [useful compilation of **all** the review articles](http://savage.net.au/Module-reviews.html) that kind folks had written over time comparing the myriad CPAN modules available for a task.

Thanks, Ron.
