HackerNews presented me today with this article by Stephen Diehl:
[What I Wish I Knew When Learning Haskell](http://dev.stephendiehl.com/hask/).

It appears to be a "cheatsheet" of all the important haskell concepts
that one should learn. Also, it should provide a roadmap of sorts for
learning haskell.

I suppose I will be visiting this document often.

Of course, I should start writing (for my own sake) about the things I
have learned.
