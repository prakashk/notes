There are many of those, but so little time.

* [Chris Allen aka bitemyapp](http://bitemyapp.com/) ([gh](http://github.com/bitemyapp/)). His [Learning Haskell](https://gist.github.com/bitemyapp/8739525) is useful.
* [Oliver Charles](http://ocharles.org.uk/blog/). Particularly, his advent calendars [24 Days of Hackage 2012](http://ocharles.org.uk/blog/pages/2012-12-01-24-days-of-hackage.html) and [24 Days of Hackage 2013](http://ocharles.org.uk/blog/pages/2013-12-01-24-days-of-hackage.html).
* [Danny Gratzer](http://jozefg.bitbucket.org/)

I expect this list to change as time goes on.
