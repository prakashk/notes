There are many of those, but so little time.

* [Brian O'Sullivan](http://www.serpentine.com/blog/) -- author of the book [Real World Haskell](http://book.realworldhaskell.org/].
* [Chris Allen aka bitemyapp](http://bitemyapp.com/) ([gh](http://github.com/bitemyapp/)). His [Learning Haskell](https://gist.github.com/bitemyapp/8739525) is useful.
* [Conal Elliott](http://conal.net/blog/) -- known for Functional Reactive Programming among other things.
* [Danny Gratzer](http://jozefg.bitbucket.org/)
* [Gabriel Gonzalez](http://www.haskellforall.com/)
* [Justine Le](http://blog.jle.im) -- jle` on #haskell
* [Oliver Charles](http://ocharles.org.uk/blog/). Particularly, his advent calendars [24 Days of Hackage 2012](http://ocharles.org.uk/blog/pages/2012-12-01-24-days-of-hackage.html) and [24 Days of Hackage 2013](http://ocharles.org.uk/blog/pages/2013-12-01-24-days-of-hackage.html).

I expect this list to change as time goes on.
